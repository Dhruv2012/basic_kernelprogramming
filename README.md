# basic_kernelprogramming
A repo for customising kernels and drivers in windows operatng system.
I used ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX Software to test these kernels on the VIRTUAL OPERATING SYSTEM.
The reason is that faulty kernels can crash your OS and you have REBOOT your OS everytime you run these Kernels.
For FAULTY KERNELS & ITS TROUBLESHOOTING ,Windows Debugger is used which runs the pdb file of the driver.
